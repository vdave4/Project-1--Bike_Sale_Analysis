# Project-1
## Bike Sale Analysis

This excel project is about the bike sale. In the Excel file, there will be a raw data, working sheet, Pivot Tables, and Dashboard.

There will be 3 main charts in the dashboards as well as filters to change the attributes. 

1. Average income per purchase- I found that when the income is higher, both genders are likely to purchase the bike.

2. Commute Distance- If the commmute distance is shorter, people are buying more bikes.

3. Customer Age Bracket- By looking at the data and dashboard, peopl who are in between the age of 31 and 54 are mre likely to buy the bike.
